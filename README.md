This is the desktop application that shuts down your computer when a wake-up signal is sent over the network to your computer. It can work to turn off the computer in response to an Alexa wolskill's request to turn on the computer.

You can install the program with the setup.exe in the publish folder. The program will automatically start and begin listening on UDP port 9 for Wake-on-LAN packets every time you start your computer.
